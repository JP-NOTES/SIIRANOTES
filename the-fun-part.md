# Intro

So you probably know how to immerse so i won't bore you with platitudes. I will just present a classification of native content that I think is maybe useful for understanding what the appropriate [i+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis) is.

#### Structured, Supported Content (Level 1)
The first level is the simplest to understand. It includes all structured content with, visual or otherwise, extensive contextual support that is not linguistic in nature. 

Let's break that down:
- This is structured content, so this means it is scripted or telling a specific story, the vast majority of the language in the content is not spontaneously spoken.
- This is supported content meaning it has some additional context clues, this usually means that it has visual support, but it could also mean any other way that context is provided to you by bypassing the language barrier.

Here are some examples of this: Anime, Manga, [Plott Anime](/what-is-plott.md), TV programs, Movies, Series, etc...

#### Unstructured/Partially Structured, Supported Content (Level 2 & 2.5)
The second level is a little bit harder than level 1 to understand. It includes all partially structured content with, visual or otherwise, extensive contextual support that is not linguistic in nature.  

Let's break that down:
- This is partially structured or unstructured content, so this means it is mostly spontaneous, but there might still be an overall direction to the content, like a list of things to do.
- This is supported content meaning it has some additional context clues, this usually means that it has visual support, but it could also mean any other way that context is provided to you by bypassing the language barrier.

Here are some examples of this: Gaming streams, Most Youtube Videos (Such as skits, etc..)

Huge gap here.

#### Structured, Unsupported Content (Level 3)
The third level is **MUCH** harder than level 2 & 2.5 to understand. It includes all structured content that has no additional contextual support.

Let's break that down:
- This is structured content, so this means it is scripted or telling a specific story, the vast majority of the language in the content is not spontaneously spoken or written.
- This is unsupported content, meaning there is no additional context beyond the actual language spoken or written.

Here are some examples of this: Q&A Stream/Video, Novels, Radio, Podcasts, IRL conversation.

#### Unstructured, Unsupported Content (Level 4)
This is a little bit harder than level 3. It includes the rest, non-structured content that has no additional contextual support. Basically this means completely spontaneous Japanese with no other information than the spoken language.

Let's break that down:
- This is structured content, so this means it is scripted or telling a specific story, the vast majority of the language in the content is not spontaneously spoken.
- This is unsupported content, meaning there is no additional context beyond the actual language spoken or written.

Here are some examples of this: VC Online, Free Chat Streams. (This category rarely appears in writing.)

Note that Level 3 and Level 4 are basically the same level and many things in Level 3 will and often are harder than Level 4, it's just that level 4 provides the least additional information for you to be able to follow the content.
