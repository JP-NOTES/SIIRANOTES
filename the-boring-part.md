# Intro

There are two main ways to go about starting, one which requires studying but is probably easier to do and the other requires finding a native/advanced learner willing to help you.

## The Boring Way
This involves roughly 1) learning kana, 2) learning about 500 to 1000 words of vocabulary through SRS and learning basic grammar (like basic particles through something like bunpro or wtv).

## The Hard Way
This is the more interesting, but probably harder way. Basically you want to have someone who is able to speak in a mix of your native language and Japanese, and you want to progressively raise the percentage of Japanese in those (ideally basic) conversations, until it becomes pure simple Japanese. This is probably longer than the other way and harder to execute but at least you don't have to actual study shit so that's nice.
